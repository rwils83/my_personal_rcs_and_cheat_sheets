## ðŸ§  Tips

- Use `-i` for in-place editing, but always back up first
- Use regex patterns with care â€” sed is greedy
- Wrap long sed commands in `"` if they contain variables
- Combine with `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, and `xargs` for complex pipelines
- Use `sed -E` for extended regex (no need to escape `+`, `?`, etc.)
